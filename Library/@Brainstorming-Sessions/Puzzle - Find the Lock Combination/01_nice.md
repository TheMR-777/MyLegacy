# Situation

Solve for: `x : x : x : x`

## Conditions

- No digit is repeated.
- The digits range from 0 to 9.
- Additional Hints:
  1. `1 : 2 : 3 : 4` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — But in wrong Position ❌.
  2. `3 : 4 : 5 : 6` — Only 3 are correct ✅ — But in wrong Position ❌.
  3. `5 : 8 : 9 : 0` — Nothing is correct ❌.
  4. `2 : 3 : 0 : 4` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — But 1 in wrong Position ❌.
  5. `6 : 2 : 4 : 1` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.

## Key

- ✅ : Satisfies the hypothesis, but need Data.
- ❌ : Does not satisfy the hypothesis.
- 💯 : Completely satisfies the Combination Set.

## Mild Analysis

- **2nd Combination**: 3 are correct. So, any three of those must exist in the final solution set.
  - **1st Combination**: 2 candidates match the hypothesis.
  - **3rd Combination**: None matches the hypothesis.
  - **4th Combination**: 2 candidates match the hypothesis.
  - **5th Combination**: 2 candidates match the hypothesis.

## Approaching from 5th Combination Set

Which states that any two digits are correct and also in the right position.

- ✅ If `6` is in the right position, then **2nd Combination** satisfies the hypothesis, but there is not enough data.
- ❌ If `2` is in the right position, that means it must satisfy the **1st Combination** Set too, which is negated its description.
- 💯 If `4` is in the right position, then it satisfies the **1st, 2nd, and 3rd Combination** Set.

Hence, we can potentially conclude that `4` is in the right position. So, the updated Combination Sets become:

Solution: `x : x : 4 : x`

1. `1 : 2 : 4 : 3` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — But 1 in wrong Position ❌.
2. `3 : 5 : 4 : 6` — Only 3 are correct ✅ — But 2 in wrong Position ❌.
3. `5 : 8 : 9 : 0` — Nothing is correct ❌.
4. `2 : 3 : 4 : x` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
5. `6 : 2 : 4 : 1` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.

## Considering the 4th Combination Set

Which states that 2 are correct and 1 is in the wrong position. Which means, 1 is in the right position. 

Considering the previous deduction, if `4` was indeed in the right position, then it is the one that is in the wrong position here (which is now corrected). So, the only possible candidates left are `2` and `3`. Since `0` is shifted to the right, it is not a candidate.

- ❌ If `2` is in the right position, then it satisfies the **1st Combination** Set, BUT doesn't satisfy the **5th Combination** Set.
- 💯 If `3` is in the right position, then it satisfies the **1st and 2nd Combination** Set.

So, maybe `3` is in the right position. The updated Combination Sets become:

Solution: `x : 3 : 4 : x`

1. `1 : 3 : 4 : 2` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
2. `5 : 3 : 4 : 6` — Only 3 are correct ✅ — But 1 in wrong Position ❌.
3. `5 : 8 : 9 : 0` — Nothing is correct ❌.
4. `2 : 3 : 4 : x` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
5. `6 : 2 : 4 : 1` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.

## Considering the 2nd Combination Set

Which states that 3 are correct. So, any three of those must exist in the final solution set. We have already deduced that `3` and `4` are in the right position. So, the only candidates left are `5` and `6`.

- ❌ If `5` is in the right position, then it disqualifies the **3rd Combination** Set right away.
- 💯 Considering `6` in the wrong position as per the statement, then it satisfies the **5th Combination** Set. WOW.

Hence, the new Combination Sets become:

Solution: `6 : 3 : 4 : x`

1. `1 : 3 : 4 : 2` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
2. `6 : 3 : 4 : 5` — Only 3 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
3. `5 : 8 : 9 : 0` — Nothing is correct ❌.
4. `2 : 3 : 4 : 0` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.
5. `6 : 2 : 4 : 1` — Only 2 are correct ✅ — and in Right Position ✅.

## Analysis

Now, since neither `1` nor `2` are in the solution set, we can revisit the requirements to find out that there is also a hidden candidate `7` that is not yet considered. So, the final solution set becomes:

Solution: `6 : 3 : 4 : 7`
