# Part 2: Accessing Shared Drives on Windows

Welcome to the second part of our series on accessing shared drives with C# 12 and .NET 8. In this article, we'll focus on how to access shared drives on Windows using command-line tools. We'll cover the necessary commands, how to format them properly, and some tips to ensure a smooth connection experience.

## Accessing Shared Drives on Windows

Windows provides built-in command-line tools that make it relatively straightforward to connect to shared drives. The primary command we’ll be using is `net use`, which allows you to map network drives and manage network resources.

### Preparation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following information:

- **Network Address:** The IP address or hostname of the server hosting the shared drive.
- **Share Name:** The name of the shared volume you want to access.
- **Credentials:** Your username, password, and domain (if applicable) for authentication.

### Creating a Connection

To connect to a shared drive on Windows, you’ll use the `net use` command. Here’s how you can do it:

```bash
net use \\<server>\<share> /user:<domain>\<username> <password>
```

#### Example

Let’s say you want to connect to a shared drive at `172.168.0.77` named `MyVolume`, with the credentials `Username: TheMR`, `Password: MR777`, and `Domain: MyHome`. Here’s the command you would use:

```bash
net use \\172.168.0.77\MyVolume /user:MyHome\TheMR MR777
```

### Disconnecting the Connection

Once you're done using the shared drive, it’s a good practice to disconnect it. This can be done using the same `net use` command with the `/delete` option:

```bash
net use \\<server>\<share> /delete
```

#### Example

To disconnect from the `MyVolume` share:

```bash
net use \\172.168.0.77\MyVolume /delete
```

### Opening the Explorer (Optional)

If you prefer a graphical interface, you can open the shared drive in Windows Explorer using the following command:

```bash
start \\<server>\<share>\
```

#### Example

To open the `MyVolume` share in Explorer:

```bash
start \\172.168.0.77\MyVolume\
```

### File Location Syntax

Once connected, you can access files using a standard UNC path format:

```bash
\\<server>\<share>\<file-path>
```

This path can be used in file operations within your applications or scripts.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Network Connectivity:** Make sure your computer is connected to the network and can reach the server.
- **Check Credentials:** Double-check your username, password, and domain information.
- **Firewall Settings:** Ensure that your firewall settings allow SMB traffic.
