# Part 5: Programmatically Accessing Shared Drives with C# and .NET 8

Welcome to the fifth part of our series on accessing shared drives with C# 12 and .NET 8. Now that we’ve covered the basics of working with shared drives on Windows and macOS, it’s time to delve into how you can programmatically access these drives using C#. We’ll explore the necessary libraries and techniques to connect to and interact with shared drives in a cross-platform manner.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin coding, ensure you have the following set up:

- **.NET 8 SDK:** Make sure you have the latest .NET 8 SDK installed on your development machine.
- **IDE:** Use a modern IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code that supports C# 12.

## Using System.IO for File Operations

The `System.IO` namespace in .NET provides a variety of classes for working with files and directories. However, when accessing shared drives, you need to ensure that the paths are correctly formatted for the operating system.

### Basic File Operations

Here’s an example of how to perform basic file operations on a shared drive:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class SharedDriveAccess
{
    public static void ReadFileFromSharedDrive(string server, string share, string filePath)
    {
        string fullPath = GetPlatformSpecificPath(server, share, filePath);

        try
        {
            using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(fullPath))
            {
                string content = reader.ReadToEnd();
                Console.WriteLine("File Content:");
                Console.WriteLine(content);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error accessing file: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    private static string GetPlatformSpecificPath(string server, string share, string filePath)
    {
        if (OperatingSystem.IsWindows())
        {
            return $@"\\{server}\{share}\{filePath}";
        }
        else if (OperatingSystem.IsMacOS())
        {
            return $"/Volumes/{share}/{filePath}";
        }
        else
        {
            throw new PlatformNotSupportedException("Unsupported OS");
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Credentials

For operations that require authentication, you may need to handle credentials securely. While this example uses plain text for simplicity, consider using secure methods for storing and accessing credentials in production environments.

### Accessing Files with Authentication

For more secure environments, you might need to set up network credentials:

```csharp
using System.Net;

public class NetworkFileAccess
{
    public static void AccessWithCredentials(string server, string share, string filePath, string username, string password, string domain)
    {
        string fullPath = GetPlatformSpecificPath(server, share, filePath);

        NetworkCredential credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain);
        
        // Assuming usage of a library or method that supports passing these credentials
        // This is generally more involved and might require platform-specific implementations
    }
}
```

## Cross-Platform Considerations

When writing cross-platform code, it’s essential to account for differences in how each OS handles file paths and network shares. Ensure that your code dynamically determines the operating system and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Using Conditional Compilation

You can use preprocessor directives to write OS-specific code segments:

```csharp
#if WINDOWS
    // Windows-specific code
#elif MACOS
    // macOS-specific code
#endif
```

## Testing Your Application

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to cover file operations and error handling.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the full workflow of connecting, reading, and writing to shared drives.
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Verify functionality on both Windows and macOS to ensure consistent behavior.

In the next article, we’ll explore advanced techniques and best practices for securely handling credentials and ensuring your application’s security when accessing shared drives. Stay tuned!
