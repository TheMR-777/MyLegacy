# Part 3: Accessing Shared Drives on macOS

Welcome to the third part of our series on accessing shared drives with C# 12 and .NET 8. In this article, we’ll focus on connecting to shared drives from a macOS environment. We’ll cover the necessary commands for mounting and unmounting drives, and how to handle potential issues that might arise.

## Accessing Shared Drives on macOS

On macOS, accessing shared drives involves using the `mount_smbfs` command, which is specifically designed for mounting SMB (Server Message Block) shares. This command provides a robust way to connect to and interact with network shares.

### Preparation

Before connecting to a shared drive on macOS, ensure you have:

- **Network Address:** The IP address or hostname of the server.
- **Share Name:** The name of the shared volume you wish to access.
- **Credentials:** Your username and password for authentication.
- **Mount Point:** An empty directory on your local machine where the drive will be mounted. This directory should be created ahead of time.

### Mounting the Drive

To mount a shared drive on macOS, use the `mount_smbfs` command. This command requires the SMB URL format, which includes your credentials and the network address.

#### Command Syntax

```bash
mount_smbfs //username:password@server/share {mountPoint}
```

#### Example

Suppose you want to connect to the `MyVolume` share on server `172.168.0.77` using `TheMR` as the username and `MR777` as the password. Here’s how you would mount the drive:

```bash
mount_smbfs //TheMR:MR777@172.168.0.77/MyVolume /Volumes/MyVolume
```

**Note:** Replace `/Volumes/MyVolume` with your desired mount point.

### Unmounting the Drive

Once you’re finished using the shared drive, you should unmount it. This can be done using the `umount` command.

#### Normal Unmounting

```bash
umount {mountPoint}
```

#### Forced Unmounting

If the normal unmounting doesn’t work (e.g., if the drive is busy), you can force unmount it using `diskutil`:

```bash
diskutil unmount force {mountPoint}
```

#### Example

To unmount the drive mounted at `/Volumes/MyVolume`:

```bash
umount /Volumes/MyVolume
```

Or, if forcing is necessary:

```bash
diskutil unmount force /Volumes/MyVolume
```

### Opening in Finder

You can also open the shared drive in Finder using the **Command + K** shortcut, which opens the "Connect to Server" dialog. Enter the SMB path:

```bash
smb://TheMR:MR777@172.168.0.77/MyVolume
```

### File Location Syntax

Once mounted, you can access files using the mount point path:

```bash
{mountPoint}/<file-path>
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Check Mount Point:** Ensure the mount point directory exists and is empty before attempting to mount.
- **Network Access:** Verify that your Mac can reach the server.
- **Credentials:** Double-check the username and password for accuracy.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the correct permissions to mount the share.

In the next article, we’ll delve into the cross-platform challenges you might face when accessing shared drives and how to address them programmatically in your C# applications. Stay tuned!
