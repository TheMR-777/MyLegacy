# Understanding Parallel Task Execution in C#

When working with asynchronous and parallel programming in C#, it's essential to grasp how different approaches affect the execution order, performance, and scalability of your applications. This guide will help you understand the differences between using asynchronous non-blocking tasks and synchronous blocking tasks within the .NET environment, specifically in C# 12 and .NET 8.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the examples and explanations, let's define a few key concepts:

- **Asynchronous (Async) Programming**: This method allows the program to continue working on other tasks while waiting for other operations to complete, without blocking the execution thread.
- **Synchronous (Sync) Programming**: This approach makes the program wait until the operation completes before moving on to the next line of code, blocking the execution thread during this period.
- **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**: A set of APIs in .NET that support parallel and asynchronous programming, helping to write more efficient and scalable code.

## Scenario: Task Execution Times

Consider a simple scenario where you have multiple tasks, each waiting for a random duration between 1 and 20 seconds before completing. You want to print a message once each task completes, noting how long it took.

### Asynchronous Non-Blocking Example

Here's how you might implement this scenario using asynchronous programming with `Task.Delay`, which is non-blocking:

```csharp
namespace MyPlayground_C_;

public static class Program
{
    private const int min = 1, max = 20, limit = 100;

    public static void Main()
    {
        var actions = Enumerable.Range(default, limit).Select(_ => TheRunner().ContinueWith(x => Console.WriteLine(x.Result)));
        Task.WaitAll(actions.ToArray());
    }

    private static async Task<string> TheRunner()
    {
        var duration = Random.Shared.Next(min, max + 1);
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(duration));
        return $"This Task took: [ {duration} ] seconds to Complete.";
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Non-Blocking Delay**: `Task.Delay` creates a task that will complete after a specified time, allowing other code to execute without blocking a thread.
2. **Efficient Task Management**: The `await` keyword lets other tasks run while waiting for the delay to finish, using resources efficiently.
3. **Order of Completion**: The tasks print their completion message in order of their actual completion, which typically shows shorter durations completing first if they started at the same time.

### Synchronous Blocking Example Using `Task.Run`

Now, letâ€™s look at the synchronous version using `Task.Run`:

```csharp
namespace MyPlayground_C_;

public static class Program
{
    private const int min = 1, max = 20, limit = 100;

    public static void Main()
    {
        var actions = Enumerable.Range(default, limit).Select(_ => Task.Run(TheRunner).ContinueWith(x => Console.WriteLine(x.Result)));
        Task.WaitAll(actions.ToArray());
    }

    private static string TheRunner()
    {
        var duration = Random.Shared.Next(min, max + 1);
        Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(duration)).Wait();
        return $"This Task took: [ {duration} ] seconds to Complete.";
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Blocking Call**: `Task.Delay(...).Wait()` blocks the current thread for the specified time, making it inactive and unable to perform other work.
2. **Thread Pool Starvation**: Using `Task.Run` can exhaust thread pool threads, leading to delays in starting some tasks.
3. **Chaotic Output**: Due to thread pool behavior and delays in getting available threads, the output order can seem random and does not necessarily match the duration of the tasks.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

To write efficient and scalable asynchronous and parallel programs in C#, consider the following:

1. **Prefer Async/Await Over Blocking Calls**: Use `Task.Delay` with `await` instead of `Task.Delay(...).Wait()` in asynchronous methods to avoid blocking threads.
2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Understand the behavior of your code using simple scenarios before optimizing for performance.
3. **Use the Right Tool for the Job**: For CPU-bound work, consider parallel programming constructs like `Parallel.For` or PLINQ. For I/O-bound operations, use asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`.
4. **Monitor and Manage ThreadPool Usage**: Be cautious with synchronous blocking calls in a multithreaded environment as they can lead to thread pool starvation.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between asynchronous non-blocking and synchronous blocking task execution in C# can significantly impact the performance and scalability of your applications. By following best practices and using asynchronous programming where appropriate, you can ensure more predictable and efficient behavior of your parallel and asynchronous tasks.
