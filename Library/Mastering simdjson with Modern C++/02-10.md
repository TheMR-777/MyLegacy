# Mastering simdjson with Modern C++

## Section 2: Installation and Setup

### Overview

In this section, we'll go through the steps required to install and set up `simdjson` in your development environment. We'll cover installation via package managers, building from source, and integrating `simdjson` with your C++ project using CMake.

### Installing simdjson

#### Using Package Managers

One of the easiest ways to install `simdjson` is through package managers. Here’s how you can install it on various platforms:

- **Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

  ```sh
  brew install simdjson
  ```

- **vcpkg (Windows/Linux/macOS):**

  First, install `vcpkg` if you haven't already:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
  cd vcpkg
  ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
  ```

  Then, install `simdjson`:

  ```sh
  ./vcpkg install simdjson
  ```

- **Conan (Cross-platform):**

  Add `simdjson` to your `conanfile.txt`:

  ```plaintext
  [requires]
  simdjson/1.0.0

  [generators]
  cmake
  ```

  Install the package:

  ```sh
  conan install .
  ```

#### Building from Source

If you prefer to build `simdjson` from source, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson.git
   cd simdjson
   ```

2. **Build the Library:**

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

3. **Install the Library:**

   ```sh
   sudo cmake --install .
   ```

### Integrating simdjson with Your Project

#### Using CMake

To integrate `simdjson` with your CMake project, you'll need to modify your `CMakeLists.txt` file. Here’s an example:

1. **Find simdjson Package:**

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
   project(MySimdjsonProject)

   find_package(simdjson REQUIRED)

   add_executable(my_executable main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(my_executable simdjson::simdjson)
   ```

2. **Include Directories and Link Libraries:**

   Ensure that your project includes the necessary directories and links the `simdjson` library.

#### Using vcpkg with CMake

If you installed `simdjson` using `vcpkg`, you can integrate it with CMake as follows:

1. **Bootstrap vcpkg:**

   ```sh
   ./vcpkg integrate install
   ```

2. **Modify CMakeLists.txt:**

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
   project(MySimdjsonProject)

   # Add vcpkg toolchain file
   set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" CACHE STRING "Vcpkg toolchain file")

   find_package(simdjson CONFIG REQUIRED)

   add_executable(my_executable main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(my_executable PRIVATE simdjson::simdjson)
   ```

### Verifying the Installation

To verify that `simdjson` is correctly installed and integrated, you can create a simple test program:

**main.cpp:**

```cpp
#include <simdjson.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const char *json = R"({"hello": "world"})";

    simdjson::dom::parser parser;
    simdjson::dom::element element = parser.parse(json);

    std::string_view hello = element["hello"];
    std::cout << "Hello: " << hello << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**CMakeLists.txt:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(TestSimdjson)

find_package(simdjson REQUIRED)

add_executable(test_simdjson main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(test_simdjson simdjson::simdjson)
```

Build and run your project to ensure everything is working correctly:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./test_simdjson
```

You should see the output:

```plaintext
Hello: world
```

### Summary

In this section, we covered how to install `simdjson` using various package managers, building it from source, and integrating it with your C++ project using CMake. Ensuring that `simdjson` is correctly set up is crucial for leveraging its powerful capabilities in your applications.
